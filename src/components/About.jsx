      <p>I'm currently in my third year of Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo, 
      specializing in electrical systems. I enjoy designing and validating hardware-software systems, 
      with a particular interest in automation and data acquisition. Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to build impactful, 
      hands-on projects that stretch my skill set. In my spare time, I like to explore the outdoors, 
      play intramural sports, and work on personal tech projects.
